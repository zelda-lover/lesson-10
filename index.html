        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite video game: Breath of the Wild</p>

        <p>I really like this game because it's an open-world game.</p>
        <p>That means you can decide what you want to do without having to follow a linear path.</p>
        <p>That being said, there is still a plot to the game, or else it wouldn't be a <i>Zelda</i> game!</p>
        <p>Soon it'll be celebrating its seventh anniversary since its release in 2017!</p>
